# LEGOBatteryBoxPCB
In case you were careless or just a victim of Duracells.

In my case, my younger self was not too careful with removing alkalines from Power Functions battery boxes when putting sets away. Sure, I can bodge the old PCB, in most cases, or buy a copycat battery box for next to nothing, but I felt like a replacement PCB for the originals would be good to have. I suspect this fits the earlier gray and red 9V box of the same style - haven't opened one to check.

This is a bit of a quick and dirty hack - which I felt should be enough for such a simple object. No improvement attempt was made - this is supposed to be a direct replacement, for which you should lift the parts from the old PCB.
The KiCad project files, ugly as they may be, are included, as well as Gerber files that you can use to get PCBs made directly at the boardhouse of your choice. OSHPark, PCBWay or JLC at the default settings will work just fine, but select gold plating (ENIG) for best results. If you're in the US, OSHPark is probably the best choice here. Anywhere else depends on shipping.

I'd love to know if these end up being helpful to you.
